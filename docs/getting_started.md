## First Thing: Basics of Using Git

### Git Clone

1. To clone a repository, first go to the repo (in this case it will be **ignition-os**).  
2. Click the **Code** button, then copy the repository link.

3. Once copied, open your terminal and use the command `git clone <repository_url>` to clone this repository.

4. After cloning, show the files with `ls` and go into the folder using `cd`.

5. Now you can see that you are in the **main branch** of the repo.  

 This is how we use **git clone**.

### Switching Branches (git switch)

1. In the above picture, we are in the **main branch**. Letâ€™s switch to the `develop` branch.  
2. To do this, run:  

   ```bash
   git switch develop

### Checking Repo Status (git status)

To see the status of the repository, run:

    
      git status
